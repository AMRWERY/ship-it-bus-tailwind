                <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Tailwind Labs Inc. ("Tailwind", "we", "us" or "our")
                    collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you
                    ("User", "you" or "your") may provide through the Tailwind UI website (tailwindui.com) or in the course
                    of purchasing any Tailwind UI products (collectively, "Website"). The Policy also describes the choices
                    available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this
                    information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or
                    to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
                <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
                <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you make a purchase through the
                    Website. Currently this is limited to your email address, which is required for you to be able to login
                    to the Website and access any purchased Tailwind UI products.</p>
                <h2>Collection of non-personal information</h2>
                <p>When you visit the Website our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This
                    data may include information such as your device's IP address, browser type and version, operating
                    system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our
                    Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for
                    on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
                <h2>Purchases</h2>
                <p>All purchases made through the Website are processed by a third party payment processor, Paddle
                    (<router-link to="">paddle.com</router-link>). Paddle may ask you for personal and/or non-personal
                    information, such as your name, address, email address, credit card information, or other Personal
                    Information. Paddle has a privacy policy (<router-link to="">paddle.com/legal-buyers/</router-link>)
                    that describes their collection and use of personal information. Tailwind does not control Paddle or its
                    collection or use of information. Any questions or concerns about Paddleâ€™s practices should be directed
                    to Paddle.</p>
                <p>Paddle provides us with certain non-personal information relating to purchases made by visitors to the
                    Website. The non-personal information may include details of the purchase such as the date, amount paid,
                    and product purchased. The non-personal purchase information may be linked to the Personal Information
                    you provide to us (typically limited to your email address, as stated above). Paddle does not supply us
                    with any of your other Personal Information such as your name, street address, or credit card
                    information.</p>
                <h2>Managing personal information</h2>
                <p>You are able to update your Personal Information in your "Account Settings" on the Website. Currently
                    this is limited to just your email address, as described above. You may also request that we delete your
                    email address, but this will prevent you from accessing the products you have purchased from Tailwind.
                </p>
                <p>When you update information, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. Some
                    information may remain in our private records after deletion of such information from your account for a
                    retention period. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore,
                    the right to access, the right to erasure, your rights to access, add to, and update your information
                    cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
                <p>We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
                    disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
                    Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you
                    personally.</p>
                <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
                <p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience; improve our
                    Website; improve customer service; process transactions; send notification emails such as password
                    reminders, updates, etc; and operate our Website. Non-Personal Information collected is used only to
                    identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This
                    statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular
                    user of the system.</p>
                <p>We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the following applies: (i) You have given
                    their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to
                    process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on
                    consent or any other of the following legal bases below. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
                    processing of Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) Provision of
                    information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
                    obligations thereof; (ii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you
                    are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                    exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the
                    legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the
                    specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal
                    Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
                <h2>Information transfer and storage</h2>
                <p>Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a
                    country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to
                    a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public
                    international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures
                    taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by
                    checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with us using the information provided in the
                    Contact section.</p>
                <h2>The rights of users</h2>
                <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the
                    right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given
                    your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing
                    of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have
                    the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects
                    of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to
                    verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the
                    right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we
                    will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under
                    certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the
                    right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if
                    technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision
                    is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is
                    based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
                </p>
                <h2>The right to object to processing</h2>
                <p>Where Personal Information is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority
                    vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
                    processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must
                    know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can
                    object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn whether we are
                    processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of
                    this document.</p>
                <h2>How to exercise these rights</h2>
                <p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner by email at <router-link
                        to="">support@tailwindui.com</router-link>. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will
                    be addressed by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month.</p>
                <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under
                    the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Website. We encourage parents
                    and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by
                    instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through our Website without their
                    permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal
                    Information to us through our Website, please contact us.</p>
                <h2>Newsletters</h2>
                <p>We offer electronic newsletters which you may voluntarily subscribe to. You may choose to stop receiving
                    our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or
                    by contacting us. However, you will continue to receive essential transactional emails.</p>
                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>The Website uses "cookies" to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is
                    placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses
                    to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the
                    domain that issued the cookie to you. We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for
                    statistical purposes to operate our Website. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web
                    browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline
                    cookies if you prefer.</p>
                <p>In addition to using cookies and related technologies as described above, we also may permit certain
                    third-party companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to users and to
                    collect and use other data about user activities on the Website. These companies may deliver ads that
                    might also place cookies and otherwise track user behavior.</p>
                <h2>Links to other websites</h2>
                <p>Our Website contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that
                    we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites or third parties. We encourage
                    you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website
                    that may collect Personal Information.</p>
                <p>In particular, as noted above, purchases made through the Website are handled by Paddle and all such
                    transactions, including any Personal Information or non-personal information collected by Paddle, are
                    under the control of Paddle. We encourage purchasers to read Paddleâ€™s Privacy Policy (<router-link
                        to="">paddle.com/legal-buyers/</router-link>).</p>
                <h2>Information security</h2>
                <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
                    unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
                    safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of
                    Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or
                    wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
                    acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our
                    control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between
                    you and our Website cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or
                    tampered with in transit by a third-party, despite best efforts.</p>
                <h2>Data breach</h2>
                <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website has been compromised or usersâ€™ Personal
                    Information has been disclosed to unrelated third-parties as a result of external activity, including,
                    but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate
                    measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and
                    cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable
                    efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user
                    as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do we will send you an
                    email.</p>
                <h2>Legal disclosure</h2>
                <p>We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to
                    comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is
                    necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or
                    respond to a government request. In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or
                    acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account and
                    personal data will likely be among the assets transferred.</p>
                <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy relating to the Website at any time, effective upon
                    posting of an updated version of this Policy on the Website. When we do we will revise the updated date
                    at the bottom of this page. Continued use of the Website after any such changes shall constitute your
                    consent to such changes.</p>
                <h2>Acceptance of this policy</h2>
                <p>You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By using the
